# SQL-Projects
This repository contains SQL projects showcasing my ability to write clean queries, analyze datasets, and work with relational databases using PostgreSQL 

## Projects
### 1. AdventureWorks2022 SQL Analysis
This project uses the AdventureWorks sample database to practice fundamental SQL operations and solve business-oriented questions.

### Skills Demonstrated

- Basic SELECT queries
- Filtering with WHERE
- Sorting using ORDER BY
- Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX)
- Grouping with GROUP BY
- Filtering groups using HAVING
- Pattern matching with LIKE n=and ILIKE
- Range filtering with BETWEEN
- Limiting results using TOP / LIMIT
- Joining tables (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)

The SQL file includes multiple queries answering real analytical questions, such as:

- Finding employees with more than 50 vacation hours
- total number of products
- top 10 most expensive products
- top 5 customers

### 2. Table Creation and Insertion
This project demonstrates the ability to design and build a table from scratch and load external data into PostgreSQL.

### Skills Demonstrated

- Creating tables with appropriate data types (CREATE TABLE)
- Defining constraints (Primary Key, NOT NULL, UNIQUE as needed)
- Importing CSV data into PostgreSQL
- Using INSERT INTO
- Managing schemas and database structure

This project highlights my ability to:

- prepare a clean table schema
- import structured data
- verify the results with basic validation queries
